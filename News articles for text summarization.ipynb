has a large disk of cold gas atoms and molecules of matter out of which stars are constantly forming', 'but ngc is a galaxy on steroids it is forming stars at about times the rate of the milky way thats why its called a starburst galaxy this made it a great target to observe with alma which can see light from the gas from which those stars form', 'this light is not visible with the human eye its electromagnetic radiation like visible light but with a much longer wavelength to observe it we use radio telescopes which look a lot like your basic satellite dish only much bigger and more

of cold gas being blasted out of the galaxy', 'whats the big deal well for the first time the new alma analysis shows enough mass in this wind to carry away a large fraction of the gas in the galaxy this suggests an answer to a longstanding mystery about why galaxies today do not have more stars', 'lets delve more into this mystery by looking at galaxies grow over the billion years since the big

gas', 'the new alma data show clearly that the gas from which those stars would form is being blown out of the galaxy its a funny kind of death by excess the very high number of stars forming in ngc generates a lot of heat blowing winds off their surfaces and these streams of heated stellar material unite to push away the surrounding gas that has not formed stars', 'when a superwind disrupts the gas clouds that might have formed more stars we call it feedback because if the star formation rate is very high the superwind is strong so a lot of gas is heated andor ejected from the galaxy so fewer stars form and the superwind dies down conspicuous overproducers like ngc are doomed it seems to cut off their own star production', 'think of it as appetite control gravity has none gravity just keeps pulling on mass particles atoms molecules dark matter if gravity were the only important effect the clouds of gas would keep condensing and forming many more stars than we see but the superwind keeps this from happening', 'alberto bolatto of the university of maryland who led the alma study of ngc explained for the first time we can clearly see massive concentrations of cold molecular gas being jettisoned by expanding shells of intense pressure created by young stars the amount of gas we measure gives us very convincing evidence that some growing galaxies blow out more gas than they take in slowing star formation down to a crawl', 'a talented science team was behind this result but it wouldnt have been possible without the new alma telescope array which was built by the us national science foundation in partnership with europe japan canada taiwan and the host country chile', 'alma is the largest groundbased astronomical project ever taking more than years from conception to operation and costing about billion with roughly onethird funded by the national science foundation it is a model of international cooperation each partner supplied a share of the antennas and an international organization oversees telescope operations', 'alma is sited in chile because the atacama desert is ideal for millimeter astronomy its extreme dryness and high altitude about feet above sea level mean greater atmospheric transparency to the highfrequency radio waves alma was designed to detect the wavelength of this light is about millimeter hence the m in the name',
